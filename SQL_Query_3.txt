Write a SQL query to retrieve sales revenue and quantity contributions by customer, calculated as a percentage of total sales revenue and quantity for each quarter and year. It should perform the necessary data transformations and calculations. The query should return a data set which consists of following columns: [CustomerName], [TotalRevenuePercentage], [TotalQuantityPercentage], [Quarter], [Year]. It should also be written according to best coding practices, including naming conventions and comments, be optimized to execute efficiently, ensuring minimal response time and resource consumption, and be designed in a way that allows it to handle larger datasets without significant performance degradation. Use the following columns in the query: [Total Excluding Tax] from table [Fact].[Sale] for calculating revenue, [Quantity] from table [Fact].[Sale] for calculating quantity, [Fiscal Year] & [Fiscal Month Number] from table [Dimension].[Date] joined with table [Fact].[Sale] on [Date] = [Invoice Date Key] for Year & Quarter calculation respectively, and [Customer] from table [Dimension].[Customer] joined with [Fact].[Sale] on [Customer Key] = [Customer Key] for Customer Name

Here is a sample SQL query to fetch the requested data. It uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to create temporary result sets for the total sales revenue, total quantity, and customer sales revenue & quantity. Then, it calculates the percentages and groups the data by customer, quarter, and year.

SQL
Copy code
-- CTE for total sales revenue and quantity per quarter per year
WITH totalSales AS (
  SELECT
    SUM(FS.[Total Excluding Tax]) AS TotalRevenue,
    SUM(FS.[Quantity]) AS TotalQuantity,
    DATEPART(QUARTER, D.[Date]) AS Quarter,
    DATEPART(YEAR, D.[Date]) AS Year
  FROM [Fact].[Sale] FS
  JOIN [Dimension].[Date] D ON FS.[Invoice Date Key] = D.[Date]
  GROUP BY DATEPART(QUARTER, D.[Date]), DATEPART(YEAR, D.[Date])
),

-- CTE for customer sales revenue and quantity per quarter per year
customerSales AS (
  SELECT
    C.[Customer],
    SUM(FS.[Total Excluding Tax]) AS CustomerRevenue,
    SUM(FS.[Quantity]) AS CustomerQuantity,
    DATEPART(QUARTER, D.[Date]) AS Quarter,
    DATEPART(YEAR, D.[Date]) AS Year
  FROM [Fact].[Sale] FS
  JOIN [Dimension].[Date] D ON FS.[Invoice Date Key] = D.[Date]
  JOIN [Dimension].[Customer] C ON FS.[Customer Key] = C.[Customer Key]
  GROUP BY C.[Customer], DATEPART(QUARTER, D.[Date]), DATEPART(YEAR, D.[Date])
)

-- Main query to calculate percentages and join results
SELECT
  CS.[Customer] AS [CustomerName],
  (CS.CustomerRevenue / TS.TotalRevenue) * 100 AS [TotalRevenuePercentage],
  (CS.CustomerQuantity / TS.TotalQuantity) * 100 AS [TotalQuantityPercentage],
  CS.[Quarter],
  CS.[Year]
FROM customerSales CS
JOIN totalSales TS ON CS.Quarter = TS.Quarter AND CS.Year = TS.Year
ORDER BY CS.[Year], CS.[Quarter], CS.[Customer];
Please ensure to adjust the schema, column, and table names to match your database. The query assumes that your database is using MS SQL Server. For other SQL dialects, date and time functions may be different. Please consider SQL injection vulnerabilities and access rights while using this query in a production environment.

Use [Fiscal Year] & [Fiscal Month Number] from table [Dimension].[Date] joined with table [Fact].[Sale] on [Date] = [Invoice Date Key] for Year & Quarter calculation respectively. Use window functions to simplify data preparation. Calculate TotalQuantityPercentage with decimal points
ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion. Here is the revised query, incorporating your requirements, and using window functions to simplify data preparation:

SQL
Copy code
WITH customerSales AS (
  SELECT
    C.[Customer] AS [CustomerName],
    SUM(FS.[Total Excluding Tax]) OVER (PARTITION BY C.[Customer], D.[Fiscal Year], D.[Fiscal Quarter]) AS CustomerRevenue,
    SUM(FS.[Quantity]) OVER (PARTITION BY C.[Customer], D.[Fiscal Year], D.[Fiscal Quarter]) AS CustomerQuantity,
    SUM(FS.[Total Excluding Tax]) OVER (PARTITION BY D.[Fiscal Year], D.[Fiscal Quarter]) AS TotalRevenue,
    SUM(FS.[Quantity]) OVER (PARTITION BY D.[Fiscal Year], D.[Fiscal Quarter]) AS TotalQuantity,
    D.[Fiscal Year] AS Year,
    (D.[Fiscal Month Number] - 1) / 3 + 1 AS Quarter
  FROM [Fact].[Sale] FS
  JOIN [Dimension].[Date] D ON FS.[Invoice Date Key] = D.[Date]
  JOIN [Dimension].[Customer] C ON FS.[Customer Key] = C.[Customer Key]
)

SELECT
  [CustomerName],
  (CustomerRevenue / TotalRevenue) * 100 AS [TotalRevenuePercentage],
  CAST(CustomerQuantity AS DECIMAL) / CAST(TotalQuantity AS DECIMAL) * 100 AS [TotalQuantityPercentage],
  [Quarter],
  [Year]
FROM customerSales
ORDER BY [Year], [Quarter], [CustomerName];
Please note that the way the Fiscal Quarter is calculated assumes that [Fiscal Month Number] field is a numerical representation of fiscal months (1 through 12). Depending on your specific Fiscal Year structure, you may need to adjust this calculation. This query also assumes SQL Server dialect. For other SQL dialects, you might need to adjust date and time functions, as well as decimal casting functions. Please consider SQL injection vulnerabilities and access rights while using this query in a production environment.

Group by Key fields in 'partition by' clauses wherever possible. [Fiscal Quarter] field doesn't exist, it's calculated from [Fiscal Month Number] field
ChatGPT
My apologies for misunderstanding your previous requirements. Here is the revised SQL query that uses the [Fiscal Month Number] field to calculate the Fiscal Quarter. It also adds appropriate key fields in the 'partition by' clause for the window functions.

SQL
Copy code
WITH customerSales AS (
  SELECT
    C.[Customer Key],
    C.[Customer] AS [CustomerName],
    SUM(FS.[Total Excluding Tax]) OVER (PARTITION BY C.[Customer Key], D.[Fiscal Year], (D.[Fiscal Month Number] - 1) / 3 + 1) AS CustomerRevenue,
    SUM(FS.[Quantity]) OVER (PARTITION BY C.[Customer Key], D.[Fiscal Year], (D.[Fiscal Month Number] - 1) / 3 + 1) AS CustomerQuantity,
    SUM(FS.[Total Excluding Tax]) OVER (PARTITION BY D.[Fiscal Year], (D.[Fiscal Month Number] - 1) / 3 + 1) AS TotalRevenue,
    SUM(FS.[Quantity]) OVER (PARTITION BY D.[Fiscal Year], (D.[Fiscal Month Number] - 1) / 3 + 1) AS TotalQuantity,
    D.[Fiscal Year] AS Year,
    (D.[Fiscal Month Number] - 1) / 3 + 1 AS Quarter
  FROM [Fact].[Sale] FS
  JOIN [Dimension].[Date] D ON FS.[Invoice Date Key] = D.[Date]
  JOIN [Dimension].[Customer] C ON FS.[Customer Key] = C.[Customer Key]
)

SELECT
  [CustomerName],
  (CustomerRevenue / TotalRevenue) * 100 AS [TotalRevenuePercentage],
  CAST(CustomerQuantity AS DECIMAL) / CAST(TotalQuantity AS DECIMAL) * 100 AS [TotalQuantityPercentage],
  [Quarter],
  [Year]
FROM customerSales
ORDER BY [Year], [Quarter], [CustomerName];
This query is following your instructions to group by key fields in 'partition by' clauses wherever possible. It calculates the fiscal quarter from the [Fiscal Month Number] field, as instructed. As before, it assumes the SQL Server dialect. Depending on your specific Fiscal Year structure, you may need to adjust the fiscal quarter calculation. Please consider SQL injection vulnerabilities and access rights while using this query in a production environment.

Let's go back to the first approach of creating a cte for total sales revenue and quantity per quarter per year, a cte for customer sales revenue and quantity per quarter per year joining the results in the main query. Leave all other changes applied after that in place
ChatGPT
Understood. Here is the revised SQL query where we return to the use of two separate CTEs, while incorporating your later requirements:

SQL
Copy code
-- CTE for total sales revenue and quantity per quarter per year
WITH totalSales AS (
  SELECT
    SUM(FS.[Total Excluding Tax]) AS TotalRevenue,
    SUM(FS.[Quantity]) AS TotalQuantity,
    D.[Fiscal Year] AS Year,
    (D.[Fiscal Month Number] - 1) / 3 + 1 AS Quarter
  FROM [Fact].[Sale] FS
  JOIN [Dimension].[Date] D ON FS.[Invoice Date Key] = D.[Date]
  GROUP BY D.[Fiscal Year], (D.[Fiscal Month Number] - 1) / 3 + 1
),

-- CTE for customer sales revenue and quantity per quarter per year
customerSales AS (
  SELECT
    C.[Customer Key],
    C.[Customer] AS CustomerName,
    SUM(FS.[Total Excluding Tax]) AS CustomerRevenue,
    SUM(FS.[Quantity]) AS CustomerQuantity,
    D.[Fiscal Year] AS Year,
    (D.[Fiscal Month Number] - 1) / 3 + 1 AS Quarter
  FROM [Fact].[Sale] FS
  JOIN [Dimension].[Date] D ON FS.[Invoice Date Key] = D.[Date]
  JOIN [Dimension].[Customer] C ON FS.[Customer Key] = C.[Customer Key]
  GROUP BY C.[Customer Key], C.[Customer], D.[Fiscal Year], (D.[Fiscal Month Number] - 1) / 3 + 1
)

-- Main query to calculate percentages and join results
SELECT
  CS.[CustomerName],
  (CS.CustomerRevenue / TS.TotalRevenue) * 100 AS [TotalRevenuePercentage],
  CAST(CS.CustomerQuantity AS DECIMAL) / CAST(TS.TotalQuantity AS DECIMAL) * 100 AS [TotalQuantityPercentage],
  CS.[Quarter],
  CS.[Year]
FROM customerSales CS
JOIN totalSales TS ON CS.[Customer Key] = TS.[Customer Key] AND CS.Quarter = TS.Quarter AND CS.Year = TS.Year
ORDER BY CS.[Year], CS.[Quarter], CS.[CustomerName];
This query follows your instructions to return to using two separate CTEs, one for total sales revenue and quantity per quarter per year, and one for customer sales revenue and quantity per quarter per year. Then, in the main query, it calculates the percentages and joins the results. As before, it assumes the SQL Server dialect and may need adjustments for other SQL dialects. Please consider SQL injection vulnerabilities and access rights while using this query in a production environment.
